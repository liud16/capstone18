PEAKABOO
========
We have designed an open-source package to identify self-consistent spectrally 
and temporally evolving signatures of charge carriers after photoexcitation in  
transient absorption (TA) data. With minimal assumption, our algorithm recovers 
and visualizes the spectral and kinetics information of the individual population 
by combining methods such as multivariate adaptive regression spline fitting and 
data clustering.

To get started using these components in your own software, please go to the
repository README: https://github.com/liud16/peakaboo/README.md
